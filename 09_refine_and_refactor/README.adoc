= 09. Refine and refactor

In this section we will try to improve certain aspects of our game that are not so good at the moment.

In the functional section:

* We will only allow words to be entered as letters from A to Z, without punctuation marks
* Only the first occurrence of a letter in the word that is not in its position will be marked yellow
* We will move alert warnings to a notification section at the top of the game board so as not to detract from the user experience

Refactoring:

* We will group the various functions in the code and give better variable names
* We will add useful comments that explain the flow of the game
* We will group the notification messages in a structure that makes them more usable
* We will create the board elements dynamically
