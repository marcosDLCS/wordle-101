= 4. Starting with Javascript

We are going to add a little dynamic behavior to our game:

* Store a list of possible words in an object / array
* At the start of the program, randomly select a word from the list to guess
* Allow the user to enter a word via input and, after pressing a button, issue an alert announcing whether they guessed correctly or not (with an exact word comparison)
* At this point, all the user's word attempts should be displayed in the lower list
* Put the current year in the footer near to the author information
