= 01. HTML skeleton

First of all, the HTML structure to support the game must be created. The document will consist of different areas:

* Title
* Explanation of the rules of the game
* Board where to display the accepted words
* Action panel
* List of all attempts (including non-validated ones)
* Footer

Start with a basic container for each row.
